# A Cooldown manager for Wow
Taking some inspiration from WAs but wanting to take a more constrained approach after WoWs big API changes

## Current State
Early phase - Just figuring out the structure and experimenting

## The goal
The goal of this project is to learn a bit about WoW api and Data-driven design in terms of creating modular UI
